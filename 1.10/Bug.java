// let's fix bugs on this code
// line 4 class name not defined so that i just called the class Bug
// line 7 the keyword isn't valid it should be static not Static
// line 10 we didnt call System class properly - the text we passed in to println method doesn't have its own datatype so we set it to string - at the end we must have to add semicoln 
// line 13 we have to specify the end of the block in this case the public class Bug

public class Bug

System.out.println("I want this program to compile");
